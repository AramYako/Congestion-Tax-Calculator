1) Thinking if I should connect to a database like sqlLite
2) Not sure how much I can change existing code, I used ChatGPT to generate code for the 60 min time limit. I felt existing code was hard to understand. And ChatGPT generate awesome code 
3) I didnt want to use existing solution "Car class" I like enums for those kind of solutions 
4) I wanted to show the 3-tier solution. Which I said in the interview I like to design my solutions. Also it worked awesome with city solution :) 
5) I didnt have time, but the API have issues with List of dates 


//Plan
1) Create Persistance
2) Create Service
3) Create API
4) Create Unit test, ask ChatGPT to create some stuff for me to speed up speed. Like dates, unit test API controller
5)
